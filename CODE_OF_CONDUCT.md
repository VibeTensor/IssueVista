# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a welcoming experience for everyone. We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and inclusive environment for all, regardless of background, identity, or level of experience.

## Our Standards

**Behaviors that contribute to a positive environment include:**

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members
- Being patient with newcomers and helping them learn

**Behaviors that are not acceptable include:**

- The use of unwelcome language or imagery
- Personal or political attacks
- Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments
- Public or private conduct that others may find offensive
- Publishing others' private information without permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including the GitHub repository, issue tracker, pull requests, and discussions. It also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders at **info@vibetensor.com**.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these guidelines in determining consequences:

### 1. Correction

**Impact**: Minor issues or first-time incidents.

**Consequence**: A private, written notice providing clarity around the nature of the issue and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Impact**: A pattern of behavior or a single more serious incident.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent restriction.

### 3. Temporary Restriction

**Impact**: A serious violation of community standards.

**Consequence**: A temporary restriction from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved is allowed during this period.

### 4. Permanent Restriction

**Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards or a single egregious incident.

**Consequence**: A permanent restriction from any sort of public interaction within the community.
