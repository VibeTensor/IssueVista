## Pull Request Guidelines

To ensure your PR is accepted:

1. **Quality Over Quantity**
   - Focus on meaningful contributions
   - Avoid trivial changes (fixing typos alone, adding whitespace, etc.)
   - Make sure your code works and is tested

2. **Follow the Guidelines**
   - Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) carefully
   - Use the PR template
   - Write clear commit messages
   - Include screenshots for UI changes

3. **Be Patient**
   - Wait for maintainer review
   - Respond to feedback promptly
   - Be respectful in all communications

4. **Avoid Spam**
   - Don't submit multiple similar PRs
   - Don't make unnecessary changes
   - Don't copy/paste solutions without understanding

## What We Consider Spam

The following will be marked as spam or invalid:

- Pull requests that are automated (e.g., scripted opening pull requests to remove whitespace)
- Pull requests that are disruptive (e.g., taking someone else's branch/commits and making a pull request)
- Pull requests that are regarded by a project maintainer as a hindrance vs. helping
- Something that's clearly an attempt to simply +1 your pull request count

## Communication

- **Ask Questions**: Comment on issues before starting work
- **Get Assigned**: Wait to be assigned to an issue before working on it
- **Report Problems**: If you find a bug, open an issue first
- **Be Respectful**: Follow our Code of Conduct

## Code of Conduct

Please be respectful and constructive in all interactions. We follow these principles:

- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Be respectful of differing viewpoints
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism
- Focus on what is best for the community
- Show empathy towards other community members
